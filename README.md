# About
*Cipher Salad* is a JavaFX application which I developed as my bachelor's degree final project. It basically attempts to recover an encrypted message as accurately as possible, without user intervention and without knowing the cipher used for the encryption.

The ciphers that have been considered for this project are the following classical ciphers:
  * Caesar cipher
  * Simple substitution cipher
  * Vigen√®re cipher
  * Hill cipher

This repository also includes my dissertation - stored in the `dissertation` branch - which explains how each cipher works and discusses the cryptanalysis techniques used to break them.

On a final note, I would like to point out that I didn't actually use *Cipher Salad* as my dissertation title, otherwise I would probably not have a degree now.

# Installation
I haven't uploaded any bundle for any operating system (and I don't intend to do so in the near future), but you can try the application out by executing `build/dist/CipherSalad.jar`. You will notice that the two buttons at the bottom are missing their arrows, but life is too short to fix this sort of bugs.
