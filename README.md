# About
*Cipher Salad* is a JavaFX application which I developed as my bachelor's degree final project. It basically attempts to recover an encrypted message as accurately as possible, without user intervention and without knowing the cipher used for the encryption.

The ciphers that have been considered for this project are the following classical ciphers:
  * Caesar cipher
  * Simple substitution cipher
  * Vigen√®re cipher
  * Hill cipher

This repository also includes my dissertation, which explains how each cipher works and discusses the cryptanalysis techniques used to break them.

On a final note, I would like to point out that I did not actually use *Cipher Salad* as my dissertation title, otherwise I would probably not have a degree now.
